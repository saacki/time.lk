# ⏰ Sri Lanka Time — [time.lk](https://time.lk)

A beautifully minimal, accurate Sri Lanka time display. Built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript — featuring smooth day/night transitions, animated sun/moon, and an API for developers.

## 🔧 How It Works

Unlike traditional clocks that rely on the client’s or server’s system time, `time.lk` fetches official time from a **world time API**, calculates the roundtrip latency, and adjusts the result accordingly:

1. **Client request → API timestamped**  
2. **Latency measured**, time adjusted based on roundtrip delay  
3. **Displayed time is independent of user's local clock**  

✅ This ensures **maximum accuracy**, even if the client or server clocks are incorrect.

## 🐛 Debug Modes

You can simulate different themes, time states, or errors by adding query parameters like `?test=flip-day` to the URL.

| Debug Mode             | Description                                                                 |
|------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `?test=flip-day`       | Live transition from night to day in 30s                                    |
| `?test=flip-night`     | Live transition from day to night in 30s                                    |
| `?test=theme-day`      | Forces day theme                                                            |
| `?test=theme-night`    | Forces night theme                                                          |
| `?test=static`         | Shows fixed time (2:30 PM)                                                  |
| `?test=day`            | Simulates 9:30 AM                                                           |
| `?test=night`          | Simulates 10:30 PM                                                          |
| `?test=slow`           | Simulates slow loading (delay before showing clock)                         |
| `?test=error`          | Simulates API failure (shows refresh button)                                |
| `?test=ahead=3`        | Simulates your local time being **3 hours ahead** of Sri Lanka              |
| `?test=behind=5.5`     | Simulates your local time being **5.5 hours behind** Sri Lanka               |
| `?test=earth`          | Shows animated Earth loader only                                            |
| `?test=anythingelse`   | Invalid debug code — displays default SLT and a debug warning banner        |

## 📡 Public API

You can use the time.lk backend to get the current Sri Lanka Time in JSON format:

**Endpoint:**  
```
https://app.time.lk/api
```

**Example Response:**
```json
{
  "year": 2025,
  "month": 4,
  "day": 7,
  "hour": 23,
  "minute": 28,
  "seconds": 28,
  "milliSeconds": 842,
  "utcDateTime": "2025-04-07T17:58:28.842Z",
  "sltDateTime": "2025-04-07T23:28:28.842",
  "date": "07/04/2025",
  "time": "23:28:28",
  "timeZone": "Asia/Colombo",
  "dayOfWeek": "Monday",
  "dstActive": false
}
```

You can append `?ts=123456789` to bypass caching if needed.

## 🧠 Ahead / Behind Logic

When users visit `time.lk`, their local time is compared to SLT:

- SLT offset is always +330 minutes (UTC+5:30)
- Local offset is taken from `new Date().getTimezoneOffset()`
- The result is shown as "Sri Lanka is X hour(s) and Y minute(s) ahead/behind you."

You can simulate being ahead/behind using:

```bash
?test=ahead=4     # Simulate 4 hours behind SLT
?test=behind=2    # Simulate 2 hours ahead of SLT
```
